    I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at the <a href='https://www.york.ac.uk/'>University of York</a>. In my spare time I'm Head of Computing at <a href="https://github.com/UniversityRadioYork">@UniversityRadioYork</a>, the UK's oldest independent legal radio station. I administer Unix and Windows servers and write software for the team.

- üõ† I'm primarily interested in full-stack web development, with most of my experience with React. I also know a thing or two about audio processing and streaming, DevOps automation, as well as systems administration.
- ‚å®Ô∏è Languages incl. Javascript (Typescript), HTML5/CSS3/SCSS, Go, PHP, Python. Currently learning Kotlin, Rust, and Bash.
- üí¨ I'm looking for a one-year industrial placement in any of the above, preferably in the UK or EU, so please get in touch! Please don't contact me about full-time jobs with a term over one year, unless you're okay with me starting in four years' time.

<h3>Getting in touch</h3>

Send me an email to the address on my GitHub profile. Please include the name of the capital of Slovenia somewhere in your email, so I know you're not a robot and give you my full, undivided attention. (Or you are a robot that's achieved sentience, in which case I'm even more interested.)
