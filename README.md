I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at the <a href='https://www.york.ac.uk/'>University of York</a>. In my spare time I'm Head of Computing at <a href="https://github.com/UniversityRadioYork">@UniversityRadioYork</a>, the UK's oldest independent legal radio station, as well as Technical Director at [@YorkVision](https://github.com/YorkVision). I administer Unix and Windows servers and write software for the team.

- üõ† I'm primarily interested in full-stack web development, with most of my experience with React. I also know a thing or two about audio processing and streaming (incl. WebRTC), DevOps automation, as well as systems administration.
- ‚å®Ô∏è Languages incl. Javascript (Typescript), HTML5/CSS3/SCSS, Go, PHP, Python. Currently learning Kotlin, Rust, and Bash.
- üí¨ I'm expecting to graduate in the summer of 2024, so if by some bizarre chance you have jobs that will still be open then please get in touch! If not, watch this space.

<h3>Getting in touch</h3>

Send me an email to the address on my GitHub profile. Please include the name of the capital of Slovenia somewhere in your email, so I know you're not a robot and give you my full, undivided attention. (Or you are a robot that's achieved sentience, in which case I'm even more interested.)
