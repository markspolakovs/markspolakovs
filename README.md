- ‚å®Ô∏è Languages incl. Javascript (Typescript), Go, Python, PHP, and just enough C to be dangerous. Currently on-and-off learning Rust and Kotlin.
- üí¨ I'm expecting to graduate with a MEng in Computer Science in the summer of 2024.

<h3>Getting in touch</h3>

Send me an email to the address on my GitHub profile. Please include the name of the capital of Slovenia somewhere in your email, so I know you're not a robot and give you my full, undivided attention. (Or you are a robot that's achieved sentience, in which case I'm even more interested.)
